## E2E TEST CASE 2: MULTI-USER SHOPPING AND CART MANAGEMENT

### Feature: Multi-User Cart Management E2E Flow
```gherkin
Feature: Multi-User Cart Management E2E Flow
  As different types of users
  I want to manage shopping carts with different behaviors
  So that I can test various user scenarios and system robustness

Background:
  Given the SauceDemo application supports multiple user types
  And each user type has different characteristics and limitations
```

### Scenario: Problem user complete shopping experience with UI issues handling
```gherkin
Scenario: Complete shopping flow with problem user experiencing UI glitches
  # Problem User Authentication
  Given I am on the SauceDemo login page
  When I login with username "problem_user" and password "secret_sauce"
  Then I should be redirected to the inventory page
  But I should notice some product images are broken or displaying incorrectly
  And I should still be able to interact with all functional elements
  
  # Product Selection with UI Issues
  When I add "Sauce Labs Bolt T-Shirt" to cart
  Then the cart badge should display "1" despite UI issues
  And the button should change to "Remove" (may have visual glitches)
  
  When I click on "Sauce Labs Bolt T-Shirt" to view product details
  Then I should be redirected to the product detail page
  And I should see product details with potential UI rendering issues
  But all functional elements should remain clickable
  
  When I click "Back to products" button
  Then I should return to the inventory page
  And my cart state should be preserved
  
  # Additional Product Selection
  When I add "Sauce Labs Fleece Jacket" to cart
  Then the cart badge should display "2"
  And both products should be tracked correctly in cart
  
  # Cart Management with UI Issues
  When I click on the shopping cart icon
  Then I should be redirected to the cart page
  And I should see both products listed (with potential visual issues)
  And I should see correct prices and descriptions
  
  When I remove "Sauce Labs Bolt T-Shirt" from cart
  Then the cart should contain only "Sauce Labs Fleece Jacket"
  And the cart badge should display "1"
  And the removed product should no longer appear in cart
  
  # Checkout Process with Problem User
  When I proceed to checkout
  And I fill in shipping information:
    | First Name | Last Name | Postal Code |
    | Problem    | User      | 54321       |
  And I continue to checkout overview
  Then I should see order summary with correct calculations
  And I should see "Sauce Labs Fleece Jacket" ($49.99) listed
  
  When I complete the purchase
  Then I should successfully reach the order completion page
  And I should see order confirmation despite UI glitches
  
  # User Session Switch Testing
  When I logout from problem user session
  And I login as "standard_user" with password "secret_sauce"
  Then I should have a clean session with empty cart
  And all products should display correctly without UI issues
  And I should not see any remnants from the previous user's session
  
  # Cross-User Cart Isolation Verification
  When I add "Sauce Labs Backpack" to cart as standard user
  And I logout and login back as "problem_user"
  Then my cart should be empty (no cross-contamination)
  And I should start with a fresh session
  And UI issues should be consistent with problem user characteristics
```

### Scenario: Performance glitch user with slow loading handling
```gherkin
Scenario: Complete purchase flow with performance glitch user handling delays
  # Performance Glitch User Authentication
  Given I am on the SauceDemo login page
  When I login with username "performance_glitch_user" and password "secret_sauce"
  Then I should experience slower page loading times
  But I should eventually be redirected to the inventory page
  And all functionality should work despite performance issues
  
  # Slow Product Interaction Testing
  When I add "Sauce Labs Bike Light" to cart with delayed response
  Then I should wait for the action to complete
  And the cart badge should eventually display "1"
  And the button should change to "Remove" after delay
  
  When I navigate to cart with expected delays
  Then I should eventually see the cart page
  And "Sauce Labs Bike Light" should be listed correctly
  
  # Checkout with Performance Issues
  When I proceed through checkout process with delays
  And I enter customer information with slow form responses
  And I complete the order despite performance glitches
  Then I should successfully complete the purchase
  And the order should be processed correctly regardless of delays
  
  # Performance Impact Verification
  Then the final order confirmation should be accurate
  And no data should be lost due to performance issues
  And the user experience should remain functional despite slowness
